<p>
  
- Go to the **Admin Panel**.
  
- Click on **Departments** in the navigation menu.

- Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name** ‚Äì e.g., "Technical Support", "Billing"
   - **Email** ‚Äì the email address associated with this department
   - **Department Manager** ‚Äì the primary agent responsible
- Configure access permissions and settings based on your workflow.
- Click **Save Changes** to apply the updates.

> üí° Departments can be used to route tickets automatically and define which agents have access to certain types of requests.

<p>
3. Teams are used to group agents for collaboration and ticket assignment across departments. To set up or manage teams:

- Navigate to the **Admin Panel**.
- Click on **Teams** in the navigation menu.
- Select an existing team to edit, or click **Add New Team**.
- Fill in the team details:
   - **Name** ‚Äì e.g., "Level 2 Support", "Escalations Team"
   - **Team Lead** ‚Äì the agent responsible for overseeing the team
   - **Members** ‚Äì select agents to include in the team
- Define the team's access level and assign them to specific departments if needed.
- Click **Save Changes** to apply the configuration.

> üí° Teams are useful for organizing agents by expertise or responsibility, especially when tickets span multiple departments or require escalation.

<p>
4. Unrestrict ticket creation so anyone can submit tickets
<p>

<p> 
By default, osTicket may restrict ticket creation to registered users or authenticated agents. To allow anyone to create tickets (e.g., via the web form or email):

- Go to the **Admin Panel**.
- Click on **Settings** > **User Settings**.
- Under the **Registration** or **User Authentication** section:
   - Ensure that **"Require registration/login to open tickets"** is **unchecked**.
- Click **Save Changes** to apply the new settings.

Optional:  
To accept tickets via email from unregistered users:

- Go to **Emails** > **Email Settings**.
- Make sure you have at least one email address configured and enabled for **ticket creation**.
- Ensure your mail fetching (POP/IMAP) is working so incoming emails generate tickets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Allowing unrestricted ticket creation may increase the risk of spam. Consider enabling CAPTCHA or using a spam filter.
<p>
