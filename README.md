<p> 
To control what agents can see or access in osTicket:

- Navigate to the **Admin Panel**.
  
- Click on **Agents**.
  
- Go to **Roles**.
  
- Open the **Permissions** tab.
  
- Adjust the settings as needed to manage agent access.

> üí° Use roles and permissions carefully to maintain security and appropriate access levels within your support system.
<p>
2. Configure Departments through the 'Departments' tab.
<p>

<p>
  
- Go to the **Admin Panel**. 

  
- Click on **Agents** > **Departments**.
  
- Select an existing department to edit, or click **Add New Department**.

   - **Name** ‚Äì e.g., "Technical Support", "Billing"
   - **Email** ‚Äì the email address associated with this department
   - **Department Manager** ‚Äì the primary agent responsible
     
- Configure access permissions and settings based on your workflow.
  
- Click **Save Changes** to apply the updates.

> üí° Departments can be used to route tickets automatically and define which agents have access to certain types of requests.

<p>
3. Teams are used to group agents for collaboration and ticket assignment across departments. To set up or manage teams:
<p>

- Navigate to the **Admin Panel**.
  
- Click on **Teams** in the navigation menu.
  
- Select an existing team to edit, or click **Add New Team**.

   - **Name** ‚Äì e.g., "Level 2 Support", "Escalations Team" 
   - **Team Lead** ‚Äì the agent responsible for overseeing the team
   - **Members** ‚Äì select agents to include in the team
     
- Define the team's access level and assign them to specific departments if needed.

> üí° Teams are useful for organizing agents by expertise or responsibility, especially when tickets span multiple departments or require escalation.

<p>
4. Unrestrict ticket creation so anyone can submit tickets
<p>

<p> 
By default, osTicket may restrict ticket creation to registered users or authenticated agents. To allow anyone to create tickets (e.g., via the web form or email):

- Go to the **Admin Panel**.
  
- Click on **Settings** > **User Settings**.
  
- Under the **Registration** or **User Authentication** section:
  
   - Ensure that **"Require registration/login to open tickets"** is **unchecked**.
     
- Click **Save Changes** to apply the new settings.

Optional:

To accept tickets via email from unregistered users:

- Go to **Emails** > **Email Settings**.
  
- Make sure you have at least one email address configured and enabled for **ticket creation**.
  
- Ensure your mail fetching (POP/IMAP) is working so incoming emails generate tickets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Allowing unrestricted ticket creation may increase the risk of spam. Consider enabling CAPTCHA or using a spam filter.
<p>
5. Configure Agents

   - **Username** and **Password**
   - **Primary Department** (determines initial ticket access)
     
- Assign a **Role**:
  
   - Roles define what the agent can see and do in the system (e.g., Admin, Support Staff).
     
- (Optional) Assign the agent to one or more **Teams** for collaborative ticket handling.
  
- Click **Save Changes** to apply the configuration.

> üí° Use roles and departments strategically to control access and responsibilities across your support team.
<p>
6. Configuring SLA Plans in osTicket
<p> 
SLA (Service Level Agreement) Plans define the expected response and resolution times for tickets. They help prioritize support and measure performance.
<p>
